# Linux_Server_Updates_Available
READ file is a work in progress

What is it?

This project is designed to work with Home Assistant.  It will create a device with a list of sensors for each linux server with the number of updates available for it.

The reason for this project is because I have many linux server running on ESXi and wanted a central location to see if any of the systems need any updates.  I was hoping Glances had that as a plugin, but it did not(at lease what I could tell).  So i decided since I was in  the process of learning Python I figured I would give it a try.  This is my first Python project and I know from past expiriences with other languages through the years this is probably not the most efficiant code that i wrote.  I will, over time, learn more better codeing skills.  I am also open to sugestions on making the code more efficient.

Tested with

Debian 10 & 11
Kubuntu 22.04
